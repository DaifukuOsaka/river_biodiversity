# river_biodiversity
R code files supporting Qing Fu for his MSc thesis project "Model-based evaluation of optimal strategies embedding diverse datasets to assess biodiversity in rivers". Feel free to [contact me](mailto:qing.fu@uzh.ch?subject=[Transparent%20Master%20Thesis]%20Inquiry) with questions, suggestions, etc.

## Navigating this Repo
This repo contains all the resources to replicate and analyze the simulation study and application. All relevant scripts are included in the folders [/R](https://github.com/DaifukuOsaka/river_biodiversity/tree/main/R) and [/Thur_casestudy](https://github.com/DaifukuOsaka/river_biodiversity/tree/main/Thur_casestudy). All relevant scripts are included in the folders [/data](https://github.com/DaifukuOsaka/river_biodiversity/tree/main/data).

## Current work
Doing some final polishing and proofreading.
